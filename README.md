# Data Driven Player Insights - Fortnite

**Summary:** 
Analysed a public Fortnite performance dataset from Kaggle to practice data cleaning, transformation, and analysis skills. Engineered custom metrics to categorise players and revealed trends in eliminations, accuracy, and behavioural factors. The output is a cleaned dataset ready for data visualisation.

**Tools:** Python (pandas)

**Key Features:**
- **Data cleaning:** handled missing values, duplicates, and impossible values.  
- **Feature Engineering:** calculated headshot accuracy (%) and defined elimination categories (Low / Medium / High).  
- **Data aggregation:** computed averages and proportions, minimum and maximum values to explore player performance.  
- **Insights & limitations:** examined relationships between eliminations, accuracy, time of day, and reported mental state; highlighted data constraints, recommendations and potential reasons for findings.
- **Export:** cleaned dataset saved for data visualization.
